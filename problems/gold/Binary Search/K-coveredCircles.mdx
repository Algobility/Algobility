You are given <Math inline>N</Math> points on the plane and an integer <Math inline>K</Math>. Your task is to determine the smallest possible radius <Math inline>R</Math> such that there exists a circle with radius <Math inline>R</Math> that covers at least <Math inline>K</Math> of the given points. A point is considered covered if its Euclidean distance from the circle’s center is at most <Math inline>R</Math>.  

For example, if <Math inline>K = 1</Math>, a circle of radius 0 centered at any point already covers one point. However, for larger <Math inline>K</Math>, the circle may need to be larger or placed very strategically to cover enough points.  

# Input  

- The first line contains two integers <Math inline>N</Math> and <Math inline>K</Math> (<Math inline>1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 200</Math>).  
- The next <Math inline>N</Math> lines each contain two integers <Math inline>x[i]</Math> and <Math inline>y[i]</Math> (<Math inline>-10^4 ≤ x[i], y[i] ≤ 10^4</Math>), representing the coordinates of the <Math inline>i</Math>-th point.  

# Output  

Output a single floating-point number: the minimum radius <Math inline>R</Math> such that there exists a circle of radius <Math inline>R</Math> that covers at least <Math inline>K</Math> points. Your answer should have an absolute or relative error of at most <Math inline>10^{-6}</Math>.  

# Example  

Input:  
```
3 2
0 0
0 2
2 0
```

Output:  
```
1.000000
```

Explanation:

One optimal solution is to place the circle’s center at <Math inline>(0, 1)</Math>, which covers the points <Math inline>(0,0)</Math> and <Math inline>(0,2)</Math> with a radius of <Math inline>1</Math>.  


<Solution>


This problem is challenging because the optimal circle is not necessarily defined by a single point or even by two points; it might graze several points simultaneously. One common approach to solve the problem is as follows:  

Basic observations:
- If <Math inline>K = 1</Math>, the answer is trivially <Math inline>0.0</Math>.  
- For <Math inline>K ≥ 2</Math>, notice that an optimal circle often has its boundary passing through one or two of the input points.  

Solution steps:
- For every pair of points, compute the circle that has the two points on its boundary (if possible). The center of such a circle is at the midpoint, and the radius is half the distance between the two points.  
- However, note that a candidate circle based solely on a pair might not be optimal if a circle of even smaller radius can cover <Math inline>K</Math> points when placed at a different location.  
- Perform a binary search on <Math inline>R</Math>. For a given candidate radius <Math inline>R</Math>, check whether there exists a circle of radius <Math inline>R</Math> that covers at least <Math inline>K</Math> points.  
- To do the feasibility check for a fixed <Math inline>R</Math>:  
  - For each point, consider it as a potential anchor.  
  - Compute, for every other point, the angular range over which a circle of radius <Math inline>R</Math> (with its center on a circle of radius <Math inline>R</Math> around the anchor) would cover the other point.  
  - Use an angular sweep technique to determine if there exists an angle at which at least <Math inline>K</Math> points are covered.  
- If such a configuration exists for the candidate <Math inline>R</Math>, then try a smaller radius; otherwise, try a larger one.  
- Pay careful attention to floating-point precision issues when performing geometric computations (e.g., using an appropriate epsilon when comparing distances and angles).  

This combination of binary search with an angular sweep (or an alternative geometric check) leads to a solution with an overall time complexity roughly in the order of <Math inline>O(N^2 \log(\text{Precision}))</Math> in the worst case, which is acceptable given <Math inline>N ≤ 200</Math>.
