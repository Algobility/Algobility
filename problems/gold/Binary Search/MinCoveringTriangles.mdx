You are given <Math inline>N</Math> points on the plane. Your task is to determine the smallest possible area of a triangle that encloses at least <Math inline>N-1</Math> points. A triangle encloses a point if the point lies inside or on the boundary of the triangle.  

For example, if <Math inline>N = 3</Math>, the minimal triangle enclosing at least two points is simply the line segment between the two closest points, which has zero area. However, for larger <Math inline>N</Math>, the triangle must be carefully selected to minimize its area while still enclosing all but one point.  

# Input  

- The first line contains an integer <Math inline>N</Math> (<Math inline>3 ≤ N ≤ 200</Math>).  
- The next <Math inline>N</Math> lines each contain two integers <Math inline>x[i]</Math> and <Math inline>y[i]</Math> (<Math inline>-10^4 ≤ x[i], y[i] ≤ 10^4</Math>), representing the coordinates of the <Math inline>i</Math>-th point.  

# Output  

Output a single floating-point number: the minimum area of a triangle that encloses at least <Math inline>N-1</Math> points. Your answer should have an absolute or relative error of at most <Math inline>10^{-6}</Math>.  

# Example  

Input:  
```text
4
0 0
3 0
0 4
1 1
```

Output:  
```text
6.000000
```

Explanation:  

The smallest triangle enclosing at least 3 points is the one formed by <Math inline>(0,0)</Math>, <Math inline>(3,0)</Math>, and <Math inline>(0,4)</Math>. The point <Math inline>(1,1)</Math> is enclosed within it, and the area is <Math inline>\frac\{1\}\{2\} \cdot 3 \cdot 4 = 6</Math>.  

<Solution>  

This problem is difficult because the optimal triangle must be found among a large number of possibilities. The key insight is that at least one of the triangle’s vertices should be a given point, and the rest should be chosen to minimize the area while still enclosing <Math inline>N-1</Math> points.  

# Observations  
- If <Math inline>N = 3</Math>, the answer is trivially <Math inline>0.0</Math> because two points define a degenerate triangle (a line segment).  
- The optimal triangle must have its vertices among the given <Math inline>N</Math> points, since otherwise, a smaller enclosing triangle could always be found by shifting a vertex to an existing point.  
- The enclosing condition can be checked using the **point-in-triangle test**, which determines if a point lies inside or on the edges of a given triangle using barycentric coordinates or the cross-product method.  

# Solution Approach  
1. **Iterate Over Triangle Choices:**  
   - Try every triplet of points as a candidate triangle.  
   - Compute the area of the triangle using the determinant formula:  

   <Math inline>A = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|</Math>  

2. **Check the Enclosing Condition:**  
   - For each triangle, count how many points lie inside or on the boundary using the point-in-triangle test.  
   - If at least <Math inline>N-1</Math> points are inside, update the minimum area found.  

3. **Binary Search on Area (Optimization Trick):**  
   - Instead of iterating over all triangles, use **binary search** on the minimal area.  
   - For a candidate area <Math inline>A</Math>, check if there exists a triangle with area ≤ <Math inline>A</Math> that encloses <Math inline>N-1</Math> points.  
   - If such a triangle exists, try a smaller area; otherwise, try a larger one.  

# Complexity Analysis  
- The brute-force method of checking all <Math inline>O(N^3)</Math> triangles works for <Math inline>N \leq 200</Math>, but checking the enclosing condition for each triangle requires <Math inline>O(N)</Math> operations, leading to <Math inline>O(N^4)</Math> worst-case complexity.  
- Using a **sorted angle sweep** or **convex hull optimizations**, we can reduce this to approximately <Math inline>O(N^3 \log(\text\{Precision\}))</Math>, which is feasible.  

# Precision Considerations  
- Use floating-point comparisons with a small epsilon <Math inline>\varepsilon = 10^{-9}</Math> to avoid numerical instability.  
- Avoid exact equality checks for floating-point values and use cross-product methods instead of division to prevent precision loss.
