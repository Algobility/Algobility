Given a series of three letters groups, your task is to determine the most frequently occurring group. The order of letters within a group does not matter — two groups are identical if they contain the same three letters, regardless of order. 

# Input  

- The first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), the number of groups.  
- The next `n` lines each contain three space-separated letters, where each name consists of uppercase letters (A-Z) with a length between 1 and 10.  

# Output  

- Print a single integer: the maximum number of times any group appears.  

# Example  

Input: 
```
5
A B C
D A E
A B C
E D A
B A C
```

Output: 
```
3
```

Explanation:
The group `A B C` appears 3 times, which is the maximum.  It is written twice as `A B C` and once as `B A C`.


# Solution

<Solution>

1. Read the input values and initialize a frequency map to count occurrences of each group.  
2. For each observation:  
   - Sort the three items in the group to ensure identical groups are treated the same.  
   - Convert the sorted group into a tuple and update its count in the frequency map.  
3. Output the maximum value from the frequency map.  

This approach efficiently handles the problem in <Math inline>O(n)</Math> time using a hash map.
