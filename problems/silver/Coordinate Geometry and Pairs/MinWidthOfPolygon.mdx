# Minimum Width of Convex Polygon

Given a convex polygon with <Math inline>n</Math> vertices provided in order (either clockwise or counterclockwise), compute the minimum width of the polygon. The width is defined as the smallest distance between two parallel lines such that the entire polygon lies between them. Output the width formatted to six decimal places.

# Input

- The first line contains an integer <Math inline>n</Math> (<Math inline>3 \leq n \leq 10^5</Math>), the number of vertices of the convex polygon.
- Each of the next <Math inline>n</Math> lines contains two numbers <Math inline>x</Math> and <Math inline>y</Math> (<Math inline>-10^4 \leq x,y \leq 10^4</Math>), representing the coordinates of a vertex. The vertices are given in order along the polygon's boundary.

# Output

Print a single floating-point number: the minimum width of the polygon. The answer should have an absolute or relative error of at most <Math inline>10^{-6}</Math>.

# Example

Input: 
```
3
0 0
10 0
0 10
```  

Output:
```
7.071068
```  

# Solution

<Solution>  

## Approach

The minimum width of a convex polygon is the smallest distance between two parallel lines that enclose the polygon. One effective method to compute this is using the rotating calipers technique:

1. The minimum width of a convex polygon is achieved when one of the supporting lines is flush with one of the polygon's edges.
2. For each edge, compute the distance from the line supporting that edge to the farthest vertex in the direction perpendicular to the edge. This distance is the altitude from the farthest point to that edge.
3. The minimum of these altitudes over all edges is the minimum width of the polygon.

### Key Geometric Details

- The distance from a point <Math inline>(x_\{0\}, y_\{0\})</Math> to a line defined by two points <Math inline>(x_\{1\}, y_\{1\})</Math> and <Math inline>(x_\{2\}, y_\{2\})</Math> is given by:
  
  <Math inline>d = \frac\{\left| (y_\{2\}-y_\{1\})(x_\{0\}-x_\{1\}) - (x_\{2\}-x_\{1\})(y_\{0\}-y_\{1\}) \right|\}\{\sqrt\{(y_\{2\}-y_\{1\})^\{2\} + (x_\{2\}-x_\{1\})^\{2\}\}\}</Math>.
  
- By iterating over each edge and using a two-pointer (rotating calipers) technique, the farthest vertex in the perpendicular direction can be found in an overall <Math inline>O(n)</Math> time for the calipers step once the vertices are given in order.

## Complexity Analysis

- The rotating calipers algorithm runs in <Math inline>O(n)</Math> time.
- Overall, the solution works in linear time with respect to the number of vertices.

## Implementation Outline

1. Read the polygon vertices.
2. For each edge of the polygon, compute the perpendicular distance from the edge to the farthest vertex (using rotating calipers).
3. Track the minimum such distance, which is the minimum width.
4. Output the result with six decimal places.
