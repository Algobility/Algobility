The local government is instituting a new healthcare plan for families of 3 or more people in New Cork Town. The plan will provide $1,200.00 for each family member in the eligible families. Given the number of family members in 6 families, write a program to return the average amount of money an eligible family will earn. If there are no eligible families, return 0. 

Note: The output may be a `float`.

# Input Format

There are 6 integers on the first (and only) line of input, each representing the number of family members in one of the families.

# Output Format

The output should be a single float value representing the average amount of money a family eligible for the new healthcare program in that neighborhood will earn.

# Sample Test Case - Input
```
 2 3 4 5 6
 ```

# Sample Test Case - Output
```
5400.0
```

# Solution

<Solution>
```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    float total = 0;    //keep track of total earning for all families

    for (int i = 0; i < 6; ++i) {   //loop 6 times (for each family)
        int inputtedMember;
        cin >> inputtedMember;


        //increment total if family is eligible
        if (inputtedMember >= 3) {  
            total += inputtedMember * 1200.0;
        }
        else{
            total += 0;
        }
    }

    //output average
    if (total == 0) {
        cout << "0.0" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << total/6 << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The program reads the number of family members in each family in a neighborhood, calculates the total amount eligible families will earn, and then prints the average amount as specified in the question.
