Create a program that calculates parking fees for vehicles in a busy shopping mall's parking management system. The program should take the entry and exit times of a vehicle and return the corresponding parking fee. The fee is determined by the following rules:

- For the first 3 hours, the parking fee is $2 per hour. 
- After 3 hours, an additional $0.5 is charged for each hour.

Time is always rounded down to the nearest hour (i.e. 2.6 hours is considered 2 hours or $4 of fee)



# Input Format

The input consists of one line, containing four space-separated integers:
1. An integer representing the entry hour (24-hour format).
2. An integer representing the entry minute.
3. An integer representing the exit hour (24-hour format).
4. An integer representing the exit minute.

# Output Format

Output a float value indicating the calculated parking fee for the given vehicle.

# Assumptions/Constraints

- Entry and exit hours are within the range of 0 to 23.
- Entry and exit minutes are within the range of 0 to 59.
- Entry time is before the exit time.
- Duration of stay is less than or equal to 23 hours and 59 minutes.

# Sample Test Case - Input
```
8 45 9 45
```


# Sample Test Case - Output
```
2.0
```


# Solution

<Solution>
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int numTestCases;
    cin >> numTestCases;

    for (int i = 0; i < numTestCases; ++i) {
        int entryHour, entryMinute, exitHour, exitMinute;
        cin >> entryHour >> entryMinute >> exitHour >> exitMinute;

        int totalMinutes = (exitHour - entryHour) * 60 + (exitMinute - entryMinute);
        int totalHours = totalMinutes/60;
        float fee;

        if (totalMinutes <= 180) {
            fee = 2 * totalHours;
        } else {
            int additionalHours = (totalMinutes-180)/60;
            fee = 2.0 + additionalHours * 0.5;
        }

        cout << fee << endl;
    }

}

```
</Solution>
