A new episode of a popular game show is being recorded. Contestants play the game one at a time and compete for a single grand prize. There are 3 spinners, each divided into two sections: "WIN" and "LOSE". A contestant wins the prize if all three spinners land on "WIN" every time they are spun. Each of the 3 spinners is spun 3 times. Write a program that calculates the percent chance a contestant can win the prize given the "chance" value of each spinner.

# Input Format

The input consists of one line, containing three space-separated float values representing the "chance" values of the spinners. Each input value is in the inclusive range of 0 to 1.

# Output Format

Output a float value representing the percent chance a contestant can win the prize. The output may be zero (0.0)

# Sample Test Case - Input

```
0.4 0.9 0.999
```


# Sample Test Case - Output
```
0.046516
```



# Solution

<Solution>
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int numTestCases;
    cin >> numTestCases;

    for (int i = 0; i < numTestCases; ++i) {
        float spinner1, spinner2, spinner3;
        cin >> spinner1 >> spinner2 >> spinner3;

        float spinner1Chance = spinner1*spinner1*spinner1;
        float spinner2Chance = spinner2*spinner2*spinner2;
        float spinner3Chance = spinner3*spinner3*spinner3;


        double winChance = spinner1Chance * spinner2Chance * spinner3Chance * 100.0;
        cout << winChance << endl;
    }

}
