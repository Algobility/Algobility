All variables in C++ are stored at certain places in the memory of a computer. The location of storage can be identified by its address.

We can get the memory address of a variable by writing the `&` symbol before the name of the variable.
```
int x = 100;
cout << &x;
```

The above code should output an address simillar to the one below:
```
0x8783fffe9c
```

Let's say we have a variable `a`. We can store its memory address in another variable `p` by creating a **pointer variable** (or more simply, **pointer**). Now `p` is said to **point towards** `a` (i.e. `p` stores the memory address of `a`). The syntax  of creating a pointer variable is the same as a regular variable with only one difference. The data type of a pointer variable is the data type of the variable it is pointing to (in this case, `a`) along with a `*` in front.

```
float a = 2.5;
float *p = &a;    //create a pointer p that points to an integer a
```
