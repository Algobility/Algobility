# Character sets
All modern computers store data in their memory (RAM) as sequences of 0s and 1s. Boolean variables can easily be stored in memory by translating them into 0s and 1s with 0 representing false and 1 representing true. Mathematicians have already devised a system of storing decimal numbers into sequences of 0s and 1s through a number system known as **binary**. However, charcaters are a bit harder to store in 0s and 1s. They are usually converted into a corresponding number and then stored as 0s and 1s using binary. However, this requires us to plan out a mapping of every character and a unique decimal number that will be used to represent that character. Such mappings are known as character sets. One major example is the UNICODE character set (some version of UNICODE is generally used by every computer). Below are the main letters and their corresponding numbers in UNICODE.


In C++, when we do arithmatic on characters, the corresponding number (the actual value stored in memory) is changed. This is why if we try to add the number 2 to the character `a`, we get `c`;

```
char myChar = 'a';
myChar += 2;
cout << myChar; //outputs c
```

We can use this to find out how far apart to characters are in lexicographical ordering. All we have to do is subtract the two characters.

```
char myChar = 'b';
char mySecondChar = 'e';
cout << mySecondChar-myChar;    //outputs 3
```

One thing to note is that when adding/subtracting a number from a character, the default data type of the final value is a number. If you try to `cout` the following:

```
cout << 'a'+1;
```

You will get the corresponding numerical value of 'b', not the character 'b'. To fix this, you can explicitly tell the compiler to convert the value into a character by using the built-in `char` function:

```
cout << char('a'+1);
```

Note: when setting a variable whose data type has already been told to the compiler, using `char()` or `int()` is not required. The compiler will automatically perform any neccessary translation to convert the number into the variable's data type.

<ExerciseAnswer>
```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

char nextChar(char input){
    return char(input+1);
}

int main(){
cout << nextChar('b');
}
```

# Strings

Strings are a special data type which we have not discussed yet. They are used to store long pieces of text. They can be initalized like so:

```
string myString = "Hello World";
```

Under the hood, strings are simply arrays of characters. That means that while a string variable looks and feels like a regular variable (and should be used just like one), it can be used with square-bracket notation. 

```
string myString = "Hello World";
cout << myString << endl;   //outputs 'Hello World'
cout << myString[0] << endl;   //outputs 'h' (the first letter in the string)
cout << myString[1] << endl;   //outputs 'e' (the second letter in the string)
```
