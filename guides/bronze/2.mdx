# Looping Through Arrays

Often times when working with arrays, you will come across situations where you need to look at every element in an array. This is known as **traversing the array**. For loops are great for this purpose. Here is an example in which we look at every element in an array and simply output its value.

```
for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {   //loop 4 times (since the array has a size of 4)
    cout << myFavouriteNumber[i] << " "; // Print each element
}
```

Here, we create a for loop that executes `cout << myFavouriteNumber[i]` 4 times. On the first iteration, i is 0 and so the first element is outputted. On the second iteration, i is 1 and so the second element is outputted. This process continues until all 4 elements are outputted. Notice how the termination condition is `i < 4`. This is so that `i` never exceeds the length of the array, 3 (since the termination condition is checked **before** every iteration and not after). Alternatively, the condition `i <= 3` also works.

# Searching for an element

Another common occurance when working with arrays is searching for a specific value amongst all array elements. Here is one method of doing so:

```
int numbers[] = {12, 45, 7, 23, 56, 89, 34};


int target = 56; // The number you're looking for
bool found = false; // To keep track if the element is found

for (int i = 0; i < 7; ++i) {
    if (numbers[i] == target) {
        found = true;
    }
}

if(found){
    cout << "Found";
}
else{
    cout << "Not found";
}
```

{/* # Efficiency

Computers are extremely fast at executing all the statements we have looked at thus far. However, they cannot perform these complex operations instantly. While the above code only takes milliseconds to execute right now, if we bump up the size of the array to a few million elements, this same code may take a handful of seconds. In competitive programming, most problems have a limit to the number of seconds a program can take to execute. This forces programmers to be creative in their solves in order to reduce the number of operations their code performs, and thus reduce the time their code takes to execute.

Let's look at a way to make the previous code much faster. Notice how our for loop runs through every element of the `number[]` array, even if it has found the target element early on. We can reduce the number of operations this code has to perform by making sure the for loop automatically ends as soon as the target element is found. We can do this like so:

```
for (int i = 0; i < 7 && !found; ++i) {
    if (numbers[i] == target) {
        found = true;
    }
}
```

Now the for loop will terminate when either it has iterated through all elements of the array, or it has found the target element. This means that once the target element is found, unnecessary time is not wasted in searching the remaining elements. In hard questions, optimizations like this are generally the difference between getting all test cases correct and getting a handful of TLE (Time Limit Exceeded) verdicts. */}

# Variations of `for` Loops Through an Array

Some problems require iterating through array elements in alternative ways. It is important to get familliar with iterating through an array in the following ways as well:

- Reversed iteration
- Skipping every second element
- Starting from a different index.

## Reverse itereration

Reversing the for loop can be done by setting the starting index to the final index of the array, terminating the loop at ‘i = 0’, and incrementally reducing ‘i’. See below for the format.

```
for (int i = arrayLength - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
    // Access array elements in reverse order with array[i]
}
```

## Skipping elements when iterating

Skipping every second element can be achieved simply by incrementing the index by 2 instead of 1. Similarly, if you wish to skip 2 out of every 3 elements, or 3 out of every 4, you can increment the index by 3 or 4, and so on. Here is an example of a loop that skips every second element:

for (int i = 0; i < arrayLength; i += 2) {
// Access every second element with array[i]
}

## Starting iteration from a specific index

Iterating an array starting from a different index is as simple as initializing the loop index to a different starting point, for example:

for (int i = 3; i < arrayLength; ++i) {
// Access elements starting from the fourth element (element with index 3) with array[i]
}
