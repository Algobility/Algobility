In programming, loops are essential constructs that allow us to repeat a block of code multiple times. They save us from writing repetitive code and make our programs more readable and maintainable. In this guide, we'll explore loops in C++ and how they can be used effectively.

# Repetitive Code: The Problem

Let's begin with an example of repetitive code. Consider a simple scenario where we want to print the numbers from 1 to 5. Here's one way we could do it without using loops:

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Print the numbers from 1 to 5
    cout << "1" << endl;
    cout << "2" << endl;
    cout << "3" << endl;
    cout << "4" << endl;
    cout << "5" << endl;
}
```

While this code works, it is not efficient or maintainable. If we wanted to print the numbers from 1 to 1000, it would be impractical to write 1000 lines of code manually.

Now let's say we are creating a program for a simple guessing game where the user tries to guess a secret number by repeatedly inputting random numbers. We could do this by copy and pasting a million `if else` statements like so:

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int input;
  cout << "I have thought of a number.\nTry guessing what number it is. "
       << "\nEnter your guess: ";
  cin >> input;

  // This code checks if input is some number other than 5. If so, re-prompt
  // user. Otherwise Say That is correct and exit program
  if (input != 5) {
    cout << "\nNot quite. Enter another guess: ";
    cin >> input;
  } else {
    cout << "\nThat is correct!";
    return 0;
  }

  // This code checks if input is some number other than 5. If so, re-prompt
  // user. Otherwise Say That is correct and exit program
  if (input != 5) {
    cout << "\nNot quite. Enter another guess: ";
    cin >> input;
  } else {
    cout << "\nThat is correct!";
    return 0;
  }

  // This code checks if input is some number other than 5. If so, re-prompt
  // user. Otherwise Say That is correct and exit program
  if (input != 5) {
    cout << "\nNot quite. Enter another guess: ";
    cin >> input;
  } else {
    cout << "\nThat is correct!";
    return 0;
  }

  // This code checks if input is some number other than 5. If so, re-prompt
  // user. Otherwise Say That is correct and exit program
  if (input != 5) {
    cout << "\nNot quite. Enter another guess: ";
    cin >> input;
  } else {
    cout << "\nThat is correct!";
    return 0;
  }

  // This code checks if input is some number other than 5. If so, re-prompt
  // user. Otherwise Say That is correct and exit program
  if (input != 5) {
    cout << "\nNot quite. Enter another guess: ";
    cin >> input;
  } else {
    cout << "\nThat is correct!";
    return 0;
  }

  // This code checks if input is some number other than 5. If so, re-prompt
  // user. Otherwise Say That is correct and exit program
  if (input != 5) {
    cout << "\nNot quite. Enter another guess: ";
    cin >> input;
  } else {
    cout << "\nThat is correct!";
    return 0;
  }

  // This code checks if input is some number other than 5. If so, re-prompt
  // user. Otherwise Say That is correct and exit program
  if (input != 5) {
    cout << "\nNot quite. Enter another guess: ";
    cin >> input;
  } else {
    cout << "\nThat is correct!";
    return 0;
  }

  // Imagine this code has been copy pasted a million times
}
```

However, I hope you can see why this is terrible code. The while loop allows us to write such repeated blocks of code in a much better way.

# The `while` loop

To solve this problem, we can use a `while` loop. The `while` loop executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition is true. More precisely, it checks if a condition is true and if so, executes some code. If the condition is false, it will skip the execution of the code block and move on, just like an `if` statement. However, it repeats this process until the condition is false. Here's the general syntax of a `while` loop.

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    while(condition){
        //code to be repeatedly executed as long as condition is true
    }
}
```

Let's tidy up the previous example of a guessing game using the `while` loop.

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int input;
  cout << "I have thought of a number.\\nTry guessing what number it is. \\n"
          "Enter your guess: ";
  cin >> input;
  while (input !=5) // repeat below code as long as inputted number is not equal to 5
  {
    cout << "\\nNot quite. Enter another guess: ";
    cin >> input;
  }
  cout << "\\nThat is correct!";
}
```

Let's go through what this code does step-by-step. First we prompt the user to enter a random number. If the inputted number was 5, the `while` loop is completely skipped as the condition becomes false. The `cout` statement below is directly executed. However, if the inputted number was not 5, the `while` loop begins (since the condition is true). We re-prompt the user for another number and store it in `input` again. If this time, the inputted number is indeed 5 and the condition becomes false, the code execution exits from the while loop and moves on to the `cout` statement below. If not, the while loop runs again and again until the inputted number is 5 and the condition becomes false.

Note: The while loop only checks the condition before running the code block.

Here is another example of a `while` loop. This `while` loop repeats a code block exactly 5 times using the help of a counter variable.

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
int i = 1; // Initialize a counter variable

    while (i <= 5) {
        cout << i << endl;
        i++; // Increment the counter variable
    }
}


```

We first set our counter variable to 1. This variable keeps track of how many times we have gone through our while loop. Then, the while loop begins and starts by checking the condition (i <= 5). Since the condition is true, the code inside the loop (printing the value of i) is executed. After that, the counter variable i is incremented using i++ (which is equivalent to i = i + 1).

The loop continues executing as long as the condition remains true. In this example, the loop will print the numbers 1 to 5 and then terminate when i becomes 6 (as 6 is no longer less than or equal to 5).

# The for Loop Shorthand

It turns out, running a while loop for a fixed number of times is such a common occurance in code that C++ has its own shorthand for it (known as the `for` loop). It combines the initialization, condition, and incrementation of the counter variable into a single line.

The syntax of a `for` loop is as follows:

```
for (initialization; condition; incrementation) {
    // Code to be repeated
}
```

Under the hood, a `for` loop simply runs a `while` loop with the `condition` given. However, it also adds the `initialization` line right before executing the `while loop` and adds the `incremntation` line at the end of the `while` loop code block.

Let's rewrite the previous `while` loop example using a for loop:

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    for (int counter = 1; counter <= 10; counter++) {
        cout << counter << endl;
    }
}
```

Note: The `for` loop does not add any functionality and simply makes code look a lot cleaner. Under the hood it is converted to a while loop.
