# Input

We have previously seen how we can use the `std::cout <<` keyword to output some text to the CLI. It turns out, we can use a similar keyword to try and get some input from the CLI.

To get input from the user, we can use the `std::cin >>` keyword followed by the name of a variable where we want to store the input. This will wait for the user to enter some text in the CLI, and then store it in the specified variable.

Here is an example

```
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int number;
  std::cout << "Please enter a number: ";
  std::cin >> number;
}
```

In this example, we first use `std::cout <<` to tell the user what to input. This is known as a **prompt**. We then use `std::cin >>` to get input from the user and store it in the `number` variable.

Note: In competitive programming solves, prompts are not used as the solves are graded by a computer (all inputs are fed by a grading machine). However, these guides will sometimes contain code snippets in which prompts were used to make the code more understandable.

# `std` namespace and the `>>` operator

Until now I have been referring to `std::cout <<` as one keyword. However, this is a partial lie as there are many parts to this phrase. First there is `std::`. C++ allows you to group code keywords under a label known as a namespace. This helps avoid naming clashes. If two variables have the same name but are declared in different namespaces, the compiler will not produce an error. 

If you recall, the `cout` keyword was defined in some pre-written code inside of the header file we always include at the top of our code. That header file defines the `cout` keyword in the `std` namespace so that if you ever create a variable or other keyword called `cout`, it will not cause conflict with the `cout` used to output text. In other words, we have to specify to the compiler that we are talking about the `cout` in the `std` namespace whenever we output text as it was defined in the `std` namespace.

However, practically, competitive programmers know better than to name their variables something like `cout`. It also becomes quite tedious to write `std::` before each occurance of `cout` or `cin`. Therefore, most competitive programmers simply add the following line at the top of their code

```
using namespace std;
```

This tells the compiler to consider everything as part of the `std` namespace. In other words, the compiler simply attaches an invisible `std::` before every variable or keyword. With this line, a programmer no longer needs to write `std::` before `cout`. On the flip side, now if a programmer try to declare a variable by the name of `cout`, the compiler **will** give an error since all variables will automatically become part of the std namespace.

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int number;
  cout << "Please enter a number: ";
  cin >> number;
}
```

**Note**: `using namespace std;` is only recommended for small programs such as those you write for competitive programming solves.

Now `cout` and `cin` are special keyword in the fact that they are not exactly variables or functions. They can be read from and written to using the `>>` and `<<` operators respectively. These operators are also quite special in the fact that they are meant only to be used with `cin` and `cout`.

# Multiple Inputs/Outputs

C++ offers a useful shorthand notation for writing multiple input and output statements. Let's say you wanted to write some code which takes a character as input from the user and outputs, "The character you entered was: ", followed by the inputted character. Here is one way you could do that.

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  char inputtedCharacter;
  cout << "Please enter a character: ";
  cin >> inputtedCharacter;
  cout << "\nThe character that you inputted was: ";
  cout << inputtedCharacter;
}
```

However, in C++, you can also merge the last two `cout` statements like so:

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  char inputtedCharacter;
  cout << "Please enter a character: ";
  cin >> inputtedCharacter;
  cout << "\nThe character that you inputted was:" << inputtedCharacter;
}
```

You can do something similar with `cin`. An input containing two numbers seperated by a space or newline can be written into two variables like so:

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int firstNumber;
  int secondNumber;
  cout << firstNumber << secondNumber;
  //If the input is 
  //1 2
  //firstNumber will become 1 and secondNumber will become 2
}
```

# Endl

Some programs will use the `endl` keyword instead of `\n`. This has the same effect and outputs a newline. 

Both of the programs below will have the same output


```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "I am on the first line" << endl << "I am on the second line";
}
```
```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "I am on the first line" << "\n" << "I am on the second line";
}
```

<ExerciseQuestion>
Using Repl.it to test your code, write some code that takes two numbers as inputs and outputs the sum.
</ExerciseQuestion>
<ExerciseAnswer>

  We can write some code to do that by creating two variables. I'll call them `inputA` and `inputB`. Then we can use `cin` to feed the user's input into those two variables. After that, we can add the two variables and store their result in a variable called `result`. Then we can simply output the value of `result`.

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {

    int inputA;
    int inputB;

    cout << "Please enter first number: ";
    cin >> inputA;
    cout << "\nPlease enter second number: ";
    cin >> inputB;

    int result = inputA + inputB;
    cout << "\nThe sum of these numbers is: ";
    cout << result << "\n";

}
```
